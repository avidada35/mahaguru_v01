But I have another question for you—taking a full gap year just for traveling might not be necessary. Why not travel during holidays instead? Self-inquiry doesn’t require an entire year; when you truly disconnect from the world, it doesn’t take long to gain deep insights about life. A gap year could be a costly trade-off. Instead, a week-long travel break might be enough. Or is there another major reason for considering a gap year?"

But remember, no matter what field you choose, it will demand hard work. The key is to find a career where you genuinely enjoy the work. If you love what you do, the effort won’t feel like a burden.

Learn how to integrate your passion into your profession—maybe by starting a business in the cricket industry or building something innovative for cricket fans using engineering skills. See engineering as a tool to unlock your passion rather than a barrier. With the right mindset and out-of-the-box thinking, you can create a risk-free path that allows you to pursue both."

Physical intimacy isn’t wrong—but **it should be mutual, not pressured**.\n\nIf one partner isn’t ready or wants to wait, the other must decide: Is your love deep enough to honor that boundary?

Real love is what our religion teaches—look at Lord Shiva and Goddess Gauri. Shiva was honorable but unattractive, living in depth and detachment, while Gauri was a princess, beautiful and refined. If we go by the 'soulmate' definition, their bond wouldn't fit, yet they share one of the purest and strongest love stories in history.\n\nThis proves that soulmates are nothing but an illusion.

The difference is that IITs and NITs provide an environment where the struggle feels lighter. But at the end of the day, landing a great job still requires significant effort, no matter where you study. So don’t see this as failure. If your ultimate goal is securing the best opportunities, think of it this way: Success requires a total effort of *X* over six years (2 years of preparation + 4 years of college). Right now, your results reflect only the effort you put in during the first 2 years. Ideally, you would have distributed the work as X/3 during 11th and 12th, but since that didn’t happen, you’ve simply postponed the effort to the next 4 years. In the end, whether you reach your goal through a *2+2+2* path or a *2+4* path doesn’t matter—the total effort remains the same. Shifting your perspective this way helps you focus on the future instead of dwelling on the past. Your past self lacked the maturity and understanding you have today.

Just sit among people without using your phone. Observe how others behave and notice what thoughts arise in your mind. Your brain might urge you to check your phone to avoid feeling awkward. But resist that urge. Observe yourself as if you’re a third person watching your own reactions. This will help you realize that most of your fears are just illusions.  \n\n3. **Practice meditation and positive affirmations** – Meditation helps calm your mind and reduce unnecessary overthinking. Pair it with positive self-talk and prayer to reinforce confidence.  \n\n4. **Learn the basics of communication and psychology** – Understanding how conversations work will make social interactions feel more natural. Study body language, tone, and the psychology of engaging conversations.  \n\n5. **Push yourself into uncomfortable situations** – At the end of the day, confidence comes from experience. As a man, you must learn to express yourself. If you stay silent out of fear, people may take advantage of you.  \n\nFinally, embrace your nature. If you're naturally introverted, you don’t need to force yourself to become an extrovert.

All they truly want is for you to live a simple, stable, and less hectic life—because they’ve experienced hardships themselves and don’t want you to go through the same. Now, let’s break this down logically. **Your minimum responsibility** is to achieve a basic level of financial stability. This includes: - Owning your own home. - Being able to support a comfortable life for yourself, your spouse, and your children. - Covering your parents’ medical and living expenses. - Maintaining an average or slightly better lifestyle compared to what your parents had. This isn’t just an expectation—it’s a necessity. If you can’t achieve this level of success within the next 7–10 years, your parents may see you as a failure. But here’s the real question: **Does simply fulfilling these needs make your parents truly proud?** If you only manage to secure a typical middle-class life, will that be enough to make them feel proud of you? If you think the answer is no, let me tell you what it really takes to make them proud."

Reaching that level of pride requires **consistent effort, unwavering focus, and relentless discipline** for the next 5–7 years. It won’t be easy—you’ll face countless ups and downs. But the depth of your struggles will depend on how strong your desire is to give them that proud moment. If you simply *say* you want to make them proud, nothing will change. You might look for shortcuts and avoid the disciplined, long-term path that demands stepping out of your comfort zone. But if your desire is truly your top priority, if you have the **courage** to stay committed, then you **can** achieve it. So, what does real **pride** look like for your parents? It happens when you **achieve at least 10x the success** your father built through 40 years of struggle—within just 10 years of your own. Imagine that moment when he sees you accomplish what he couldn't in his entire lifetime. That’s the **greatest** pride a parent can feel. Now, this might sound impractical or overhyped, but the real question isn’t *whether* it’s possible—the question is: **Can YOU make it possible?** With the right actions, at the right time, nothing is impossible. You just need a clear plan. And I’m here to help you with that.

When I’m solving a coding problem, I get small wins that keep me engaged, but when I read theory, there’s no immediate reward—it feels like I’m just absorbing information without any real excitement.\n\nSo, I guess my brain craves dopamine because studying doesn’t provide enough of it.

This problem arises mainly when studying theoretical subjects because your brain naturally resists tasks that aren’t engaging or exciting. So, how do we deal with this? The only way is to make theoretical learning more interesting by connecting it to real-life examples and learning in a storytelling format.\n\nAdditionally, you need to train your brain to focus and become comfortable with uncomfortable situations. There are several techniques and tools to help with this. In the end, the real issue isn’t distraction itself—it’s about making studying engaging and training your brain to stay focused even in less stimulating situations. Your maturity and seriousness toward your goals will ultimately help you push through and get things done. Do you understand?"
